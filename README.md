# Postfix++
I've designed this Postfix++ interpreter to prioritize memory efficiency and fast retrieval using minimal resources. It employs two linked lists: one for single values (stack for user input tokens) and another for key-value pairs (hash table for variables). The hash table uses separate chaining for collision handling and dynamically resizes to maintain efficiency, starting with 3 buckets (chains of max-length 2), expanding to 6 buckets (chains of max-length 2), and finally to 9 buckets (chains of max-length 2), to accommodate all 26 letters (A to Z). A cap on chain length ensures that retrieval time via Linear Search remains O(1). The hash function adapts based on the user's first input variable to minimize resizing. For example, if 'X' is the first input, the hash function predicts 'Y' and optimizes accordingly. The interpreter supports various mathematical functions, including basic operations, exponentiation, nth root, modulo, factorial, logarithm, trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions. Additional functions can be added easily if needed.
## Consideration
1. The current design is optimized for the target hardware (a small scientific calculator). So, the implementation only supports capital letters (A-Z) for variables. Expanding this to support both upper and lower case letters, and potentially strings, would require redesigning the hash table and its methods (like resizing). I could modify the hash function to handle a wider range of keys or consider using a trie data structure.
2. Error handling is another area with room for improvement. Comprehensive error checks for invalid inputs and overflow should be added. Implementing a testing framework to cover unusual inputs would improve reliability.
3. A help menu for users is currently missing. Implementing a `help` command that displays a menu when the user inputs `help`, documenting all supported operators and their syntax.
4. Handling very large numbers is limited by the language constraints. This can be addressed by using libraries like GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library).
5. There is number accuracy issue due to the limitations of double precision in iterative methods like the Babylonian method or the Taylor series, leading to rounding errors. To remedy this, I would use libraries such as GMP for higher precision calculations. I could also enhance the algorithms by exploring error compensation methods like Kahan summation.
